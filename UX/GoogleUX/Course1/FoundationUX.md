## Role of entry-level UX designer 
### User research 
"Through research, you'll learn about users' backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emothions, and goals."
### Information architecture 
Information architecture (IA) decide how the product is organized and structured. 
### Wireframing 
"Basic outline or sketch of a product or screen. [...] mostly lines and shapes, with some text."
### Prototyping
Physical or digital formats, can vary in complexity. Can be to show a specific feature or a more complext and holistic product. 
### Visual design
Focuses on how the product or technology looks. 
### Effective communication
The art of collaborating with the other member of a teams. 

# Design Thinking: A UX design framework

Design thinking : "a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, protyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their probems are, and what your design should include"
Not a linear process but an iterative one.

Phases :
- Empathize : learn more about user and their problems, needs, and the environment/context where designing
- Define : From the information of the emphatize phase, defining the most important problem and why. The output should be a clear **problem statement**
- Ideate : The first step of ideation should be to propose lot of design solution through collaborative brainstorming. Then picking out the best solution for the problem
- Prototype : Producing an early model of a product to "demonstrates its functionality"
- Test : Testing the prototype (in dialectical with the prototype phase)

# Get to know UX design best practices and trends

## Universal design, inclusive design and equity-focused design 
The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations. 

Inclusive design : making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race economic status, language, age and gender. 
Inclusive design must be done by having marginal people in the process of creation to have their perspective too. 

Universal design = "One size fits all"

Inclusive design = "Solve for one, extend to many"

There is no average person in inclusive design.

Accessibility : The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 

Equity-focused design : Designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products. 

Equality : providing the same amount of opportunity and support. 
Equity : providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes. 

# Design Sprints

Design sprint : A time-bound process, with five phases typically spread over 5 full 8-hour days. 

The goal of design sprint : solve a critical challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 

Five phases : Understand, Ideate, Decide, Prototype and Test

## Planning a design sprints
- User research
- Call in the experts
- Find the right space
- Gather supplies
- Plan introduction
- Post-sprint planning

## Sprint brief
A document that you share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint. 

## Sprint retrospectives
A collaborative critique of the team's design sprint. 
"Questions you might ask during this part of the retrospective include:

Which tools saved you the most time and effort?

When did you feel the most satisfaction?

What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?"
## Introduction to UX research
"UX research Focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback. "
UX development is a continuous process of the product development life cycle

### Foundational research
"Always done before you start designing."
"Answers the questions :
- What should we build?
- Waht are the user problems?
- How can we solve them?"
### Design research 
"Design research answers the question : How should we built it?"

# Explore UX Research Methods 

## Choose the right research method. 

### Who conduct the research?
- Primary research : "research you conduct yourself."
- Secondary research : "research that uses information someone else has put together"  

### What is the type of data collected?
- Quantitative research (what) : "Focuses on data that can be gathered bu counting or measuring"
- Qualitative research (why) : "Focuses on observations about why and how things happen"

### Methods 
Interviews : "A research method used to collect in-depth information on peoples's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings."
Surveys : "An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product." Mix of quantitatives and qualitatives data. 
Usability study : "A technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users"

Key performance indicator (KPIs) : "Critical measure of progress toward an end goal"

## Understand benefits and drawbacks of research methods
At the start of a project, secondary research is a good starting point. 

# Identify types of Bias in Ux research
Bias "Favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information."
- Confirmation bias : "Occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have"
    - Overcoming confirmation bias : "Ask open-ended questions, actively listen, include a large sample of users" 
- False consensus biais : " Overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or deisgn."
    - Overcoming confirmation bias : "identify and articulate your own assumptions, survey large group of people"
- Recency bias : " It's easiest to remember the last thing you heard"
    - Overcoming the recency biais : details note and recording. 
- Primacy biais : "Remember the first participant most strongly." 
    - Overcoming recency & primacy biais : "Take detailed notes or recording, interview each participant in the same way".  
- Implicit biais : "The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge." 
    - Overcoming implicit biais : "reflect on our own behaviors, ask others to point out our implicit biases"
- Sunk cost fallacy : "the deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course"
    - Overcoming sunk cost fallacy : "break down your project into smaller phases, outline points where you can decide whether to continue or stop."
