# Design Thinking: A UX design framework

Design thinking : "a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, protyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their probems are, and what your design should include"
Not a linear process but an iterative one.

Phases :
- Empathize : learn more about user and their problems, needs, and the environment/context where designing
- Define : From the information of the emphatize phase, defining the most important problem and why. The output should be a clear **problem statement**
- Ideate : The first step of ideation should be to propose lot of design solution through collaborative brainstorming. Then picking out the best solution for the problem
- Prototype : Producing an early model of a product to "demonstrates its functionality"
- Test : Testing the prototype (in dialectical with the prototype phase)

## Universal design, inclusive design and equity-focused design 
The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations. 

Inclusive design : making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race economic status, language, age and gender. 
Inclusive design must be done by having marginal people in the process of creation to have their perspective too. 

Universal design = "One size fits all"

Inclusive design = "Solve for one, extend to many"

There is no average person in inclusive design.

Accessibility : The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 

Equity-focused design : Designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products. 

Equality : providing the same amount of opportunity and support. 
Equity : providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes.
