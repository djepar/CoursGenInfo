# Design Thinking: A UX design framework

Design thinking : "a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, protyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their probems are, and what your design should include"
Not a linear process but an iterative one.

Phases :
- Empathize : learn more about user and their problems, needs, and the environment/context where designing
- Define : From the information of the emphatize phase, defining the most important problem and why. The output should be a clear **problem statement**
- Ideate : The first step of ideation should be to propose lot of design solution through collaborative brainstorming. Then picking out the best solution for the problem
- Prototype : Producing an early model of a product to "demonstrates its functionality"
- Test : Testing the prototype (in dialectical with the prototype phase)
