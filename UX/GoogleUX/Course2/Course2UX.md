# Empathize with users
Empathy : "the ability to understand someone else's feeling or thoughts in a situation. "
"UX design is not about solving problems we assume users wnat solved. It's about solving problems that users actually want solved."

### Tips to empathize with users 
- "Ask lots of (open-ended) questions
- Become more observant
- Be an active listener 
- Request input
- Have an open mind
- Keepcurrent on UX research

## Recruit interview participants
"Representative sample : A subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group". 

## Determine research goals and questions

Researchs goals "when it comes to empathizing with users":
"
- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve. 
- I want to identify common unser behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address. 
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I'm designing. "

Best practices related to interview questions:
- "Ask open-ended questions
- Keep questions short and simple. 
- Ask follow-up questions."

## Empathy Maps 
What the users : says, thinks, does and feels

Aggregated empathy maps : represent a visualization of everything designers know about an entire user segment or group of similar users.

# Identify user pain points
Pain Points : "Any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need"
__Types of Pain Points__ :
- Financial (paywall)
- Product (quality issue)
- Process (a -/-> b)
- Support

# Create personas
Personas : "Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users"
Create through research. 
1. Which user group the persona represents
    - User group : "A set of people who have similar interests, goals, or concerns." 
2. Build a persona
   1. Photo
   2. Info : age, education, hometown, family, occupacion
   3. Brief story or scenario
   4. Goals and frustration
   5. Quote capturing the attitude or personality

# Craft user stores 
User story : "A fictoinal one-sentence story told from the persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions."
Structure : "As a [type of user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"

# Create a user journey map
User journey : "The series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal".

Journey map : a graphic representation of the user journey

Benefits of user journey mapping:
- Helps UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users.
- Reduces impact of designer bias.
- Highlights the pain points.
- Identifies improvement opportunities
  
# Accessibility 
Curb cut effect : "A phenomenon that describes how products and policies designed for people with disabilities often end up helping everyone."

# Define problem and hypothesis statements
## Create problem statements
Problem statement : "A clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed"
- Human-centered
- Broad enough for creative freedom
- Narrow enough to be solved by a design

Structure : "[username] is a [user characteristics] who needs [user needs] because [insight]"
Example : "Aman is an athlete who needs to sign up for workout classes because the class he wants to participate in fills up fast"

Problem statement let us :
- Establish goals
- Understand constraints
- Define deliverables
- Create benchmarks for success

The 5 Ws and H help to formulate the problem statement: who, what, when, where, why, and how (from https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/design-problem-statement)

The Four Ws : Question to Answer :
- Who is afected?
- What is the problem?
- Where does it happen?
- Why does it matter?
(from https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/design-problem-statement)

## Define hypothesis statements
Hypothesis statement : "Our best educated guess on what we thiknk the solution to a design problem migh be"

Structure : "If [action] then [outcome]"

Example : "__If__ Amal download the gyms app, __then__ he can reserve his favorite class in advance"

OR

"We believe that [action] for [user] would [outcome]"

Example "__We believe that__ a simplified mode of the dog walker app __for__ Arnold __will__ allow them to hire dog walker efficently".

# Create a value proposition
## Determine a value proposition
Value proposition : "the reason why a consumer should use a product or service"
"""
- What does your product do?
- Why should the user care?
"""
Steps : 
"""
1. Describe your product's features and benefits
2. Explain the value of the product (the features organise by value)
3. Connect these features and benefits with the needs of your users
4. Review your official value proposition list

# Explore the influence of psychology in UX design
## Understand human factors 
The human factor "refers to the range of variables humans bring to their product interactions. Common human factors that inform design include but are not limited to limited concentration, impatience, fears, prejudices, and limited memory"

## Psychology principles that influence design
Von Restorff effect (Isolation effect): "When multiple, similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered"

Call-to-action (CTA) : "A visual prompt that tells the user to take action"
The CTA should stand out.

Serial position effect : "When people are given a list of items, they are more likely to remember the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle tend to blur"

Hick's Law : "The more options a user has the longer it takes for them to make a decision"

# Understand design ideation
Ideation : "The rocess of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic, with no attempt to judge or evaluate them"
Evaluate the ideas : 
"""
- Feasible : Technically possible to build
- Desirable : Best at solving the user problem
- Viable : Financially beneficial for the business
"""
Steps : "Brainstorming out loud, documenting all ideas, focusing on quantity without allowing evaluation, gathering a diverse team, questioning the obvious, then evaluating the ideas."

Preparing for ideation : 
"""
- Empathize with your users : by creating empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps.
- Define the problem 
- Establish a creative environment
- Set a time limit
- Assemble a diverse team
- Think outise the box
