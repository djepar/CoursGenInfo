# Empathize with users
Empathy : "the ability to understand someone else's feeling or thoughts in a situation. "

"Representative sample : A subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group". 

## Determine research goals and questions

Researchs goals "when it comes to empathizing with users":
"
- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve. 
- I want to identify common unser behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address. 
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I'm designing. "

- Keep questions short and simple. 
- Ask follow-up questions."
