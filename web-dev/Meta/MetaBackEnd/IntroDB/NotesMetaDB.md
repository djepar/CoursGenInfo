# Databases and data 
## Type of data contains in database
- Object-oriented database --> data store as objects
- Graph databases --> data stored as nodes
- document databases --> stored as JSON objects

## How is data related?
The columns is call the fields
The rows are call rows. 
A whole row is an entity
"A Primary Key field contains unique values that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the table. This avoids potential confusion between tables with similarities in data"
"A foreign key is a field in one table that connects to the primary key field in the original table"

## Alternative types of databases
- Relational databases: "Used or storing structured data in tabular format".
- NoSQL databases : "provide a flexible structure for storing and scaling data"
  - "Document databases
  - Key-value databases
  - Graph databases"

Big data is 
- Types of data "combination of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data"
- Data power: "more powerful than traditional data when solving problems"
- Data insights : "Provides unique insights to help improve decision making"
