## Tools : SFrame and Turi Create

Using Python for ML is good, but using crate can be complicated, so they made Turi Create which simplify the use of different ML algorithms and tools. 

SFrame is  equivalent to Panda, but easier to scale for big project.

### Using Turi Create with venv
See : https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
1. Install virtualenv : `pip install virtualenv`
2. "Top create and activate a Python virtual environment called venv :
   1. `python3.8 -m venv venv`
   2. Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process (if problem with step 3)
   3. `.\Activate.ps1` (in Scripts)
