# Cybersecurity Foundations
## What is cybersecurity
"It is the art of protecting networks, devices and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information sources."

- Networks : "Move data from place to place"
- Devices : "Process and store data"
- Data : "Our most valuable asset"

How do these all work together? "When you visit a website on the internet you're using your device which can store and process data, to access another device called a web server, which can also store and process data. You are accessing this data on that webserver using a bunch of connected networks that allow data to move from place to place. This includes your own network at home"

## The CIA Triad
- Confidentiality : "Keep our data private
  - Redundancy
- Integrity : "Make sure only authorized changes happen to our data"
  - Hashing
- Availability : "Make sure our data is accessible and available when we need it."
  - Encryption/Authentification
