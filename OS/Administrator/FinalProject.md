# Question 1
- Creating a registry of laptop so it's easier to track laptops and who have them. So putting a label for the laptop and creating a list, with the name of the person, the serial number of the laptop and the id of the user.
- Also, maybe start to buy more similar laptop for easier maintenance. Even thought, we need to keep in mind, the different needs (cpu strenght, needs for a gpu, ram, etc). 
- Change the cloud service to have an Active Directory so
  - we can implement strict password requirement
  - give HR a way to retrieve password for employees. 
  - Create different restrictions based on the needs of each employees title.
