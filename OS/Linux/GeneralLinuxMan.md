Intro 
"An operating system takes on all this undifferentiated heavy lifting abstracting away the different hardware components and providing you with a (usually) clean and nicely designed Application Programming Interface (API), such as is the case with the Linux kernel [...]. We usually call these APIs that an OS exposes system calls or syscalls for short." (Hausenblas, 3%)
